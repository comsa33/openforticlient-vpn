   - Status bar will show "VPN: Reconnecting... (attempt count)"
   - If reconnection succeeds, normal connection is restored
   - If all reconnection attempts fail, status changes to "VPN: Reconnect Failed"

3. Control auto-reconnect:

   - Click the retry icon after max retries to manually try again

3. Metrics are automatically updated while connection is active

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails

1. Verify that the `openfortivpn` tool is properly installed.
2. Test if the openfortivpn command runs directly in the terminal.
3. Confirm that the host, port, and username in your profile are correct.
4. Make sure you've entered the correct password as administrator privileges (sudo) are required.
5. Check the connection logs using the "Show Connection Logs" command for more details about the error.

### If VPN Status Is Not Displayed Correctly

1. Try restarting VS Code.
2. Check if the ppp0 interface exists using the `ip addr` or `ifconfig` command in the terminal.
3. View the connection logs to see if any errors were reported during connection attempts.

### If Auto-Reconnect Is Not Working

1. Verify that auto-reconnect is enabled in the extension settings.
2. Make sure you have saved the password for the active profile (auto-reconnect requires a saved password).
3. Check the connection logs for any errors during reconnection attempts.
4. If reconnection fails after all attempts, use the "Retry Connection" command to try again manually.
